# AI in Biology Final Project

## Group: Saba Jawata and Marisabel Morales

The dataset used in this project includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 17 attributes and 2111 records, the records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III. 

The data and complete information about the variables is available in: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition

The objective of this notebook is to show how to develop a model to predict obesity. The first model predicts presence or absence of obesity, which includes every level after Normal Weight, and the second model predicts the specific level.
